                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">Diabetes</h2>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.</p>

                                    <p> <br>TYPE 1 DIABETES<br></p>
                                        Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction where the body’s defence system attacks the cells that produce insulin. As a result, the body produces very little or no insulin. The exact causes of this are not yet known, but are linked to a combination of genetic and environmental conditions.<br>

                                        Type 1 diabetes can affect people at any age, but usually develops in children or young adults. People with type 1 diabetes need daily injections of insulin to control their blood glucose levels. If people with type 1 diabetes do not have access to insulin, they will die.<br>

                                        The risk factors for type 1 diabetes are still being researched. However, having a family member with type 1 diabetes slightly increases the risk of developing the disease. Environmental factors and exposure to some viral infections have also been linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes.<br></p>

                                        <p> <br>SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES<br></p>
                                        The most common symptoms of type 1 diabetes include:

                                        
                                        Abnormal thirst and dry mouth<br>
                                        Sudden weight loss<br>
                                        Frequent urination<br>
                                        Lack of energy, tiredness<br>
                                        Constant hunger<br>

                                         <p> <br>SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES<br></p>
                                         The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. Usually, the body's own immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses — mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing (islet, or islets of Langerhans) cells in the pancreas. Other possible causes include:

                                         Genetics<br>
                                         Exposure to viruses and other environmental factors<br></p>

                                         <p> <br>PREVENTION OF TYPE 1 DIABETES<br>
                                         Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. Doctors can't even tell who will get it and who won't.<br></p>

                                         No one knows for sure what causes type 1 diabetes, but scientists think it has something to do with genes. But just getting the genes for diabetes isn't usually enough. In most cases, a child has to be exposed to something else — like a virus — to get type 1 diabetes.<br>

                                         Type 1 diabetes isn't contagious, so kids and teens can't catch it from another person or pass it along to friends or family members. And eating too much sugar doesn't cause type 1 diabetes, either.<br>

                                         There's no reliable way to predict who will get type 1 diabetes, but blood tests can find early signs of it. These tests aren't done routinely, however, because doctors don't have any way to stop a child from developing the disease, even if the tests are positive.<br></p>

                                          <p> <br>TYPE 2 DIABETES<br></p>
                                          Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong disease that keeps your body from using insulin the way it should. People with type 2 diabetes are said to have insulin resistance.

                                          People who are middle-aged or older are most likely to get this kind of diabetes. It used to be called adult-onset diabetes.

                                            Signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly. In fact, you can be living with type 2 diabetes for years and not know it. When signs and symptoms are present, they may include: <br></p>

                                            <p> <br>TYPE 2 CAUSES OF DIABETEs<br></p>
                                            Type 2 diabetes is primarily the result of two interrelated problems:

                                            Cells in muscle, fat and the liver become resistant to insulin. Because these cells don't interact in a normal way with insulin, they don't take in enough sugar.<br>
                                            The pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels.<br></p>

                                            Simple lifestyle measures have been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes. To help prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should:

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">GOITER</h2>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">The term goiter is used to describe an abnormally enlarged thyroid gland. A normal thyroid gland is not visible from the outside. With goiter, the thyroid enlarges enough that you may have a visible lump or bulge in your neck. Conditions related to hyperthyroidism1﻿ or hypothyroidism2are the most common causes, though goiters sometimes occur for reasons unrelated to an underlying thyroid disorder.</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/goiter.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <p><br>TYPES OF GOITER<br></p>
                                    Since many things can make your thyroid swell, there are lots of types of goiters. A few of them are:<br></p>

                                    SIMPLE GOITERS - which happen when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough hormones. The thyroid grows larger to make up for this.<br>

                                    ENDEMIC GOITERS - Sometimes called colloid goiters, these are caused by a lack of iodine in your diet. Your thyroid uses iodine to make its hormones. Few people get this kind of goiter in countries where iodine is added to table salt, like the United States.<br>

                                    SPORADIC or NONTOXIC GOITERS - which usually have no known cause. Certain drugs and medical conditions can trigger them.<br>

                                    MULTINODULAR GOITERS - which happen when lumps called nodules grow in your thyroid.<br></p>
                                    <p><br>SYMPTOMS OF GOITER<br></p>
                                    In some cases, a goiter may not be visible and may cause no symptoms at all. When symptoms are present, they can include:<br></p>

                                    A visible lump or swelling in the neck area<br>
                                    A lump that is tender to the touch<br>
                                    A feeling of fullness in the neck<br>
                                    A feeling of pressure on your windpipe or esophagus<br>
                                    Difficulty swallowing or a feeling that food is stuck in your throat<br>
                                    Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, especially at night<br>
                                    Coughing<br><br>
                                    Hoarseness<br>
                                    Discomfort when wearing turtlenecks, ties, and scarves<br></p>


                                    <p><br>RISK FACTOR OF GOITER<br></p>
                                    Goiters can affect anyone. They may be present at birth and occur at any time throughout life. Some common risk factors for goiters include:<br></p>

                                    A LACK OF DIETARY IODINE - People living in areas where iodine is in short supply and who don't have access to iodine supplements are at high risk of goiters.<br>
                                    BEING FEMALE - Because women are more prone to thyroid disorders, they're also more likely to develop goiters.<br>
                                    Your age. Goiters are more common after age 40.
                                    MEDICAL HIISTORY - A personal or family history of autoimmune disease increases your risk.<br>
                                    PREGNANCY and MENOPAUSE - For reasons that aren't entirely clear, thyroid problems are more likely to occur during pregnancy and menopause.<br>
                                    CERTAIN and MEDICATION - Some medical treatments, including the heart drug amiodarone (Pacerone, others) and the psychiatric drug lithium (Lithobid, others), increase your risk.<br>
                                    RADIATION EXPOSURE - Your risk increases if you've had radiation treatments to your neck or chest area or you've been exposed to radiation in a nuclear facility, test or accident.<br>
                                    
                                      <p><br>GOITER TREATMENT<br></p>
                                      Depending on what caused your goiter and how serious it is, your doctor can treat it with:


                                      Medication. If you have hypothyroidism, your doctor may prescribe a thyroid hormone replacement medication. For goiters caused by inflammation, you might take aspirin or corticosteroids.

                                      Surgery. The surgeon may remove all or part of your thyroid. Afterward, you may need to take thyroid hormone medicine for the rest of your life.

                                      Radioactive iodine. You take this in a pill to treat an overactive thyroid. It kills cells to shrink the thyroid. After this treatment, you'll probably need to take hormone drugs from then on.<br></p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">HIGHBLOOD PRESSURE</h2>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a common disease that develops when blood flows through your arteries at higher-than-normal pressures. Your blood pressure is made up of two numbers: systolic and diastolic. Systolic pressure is the pressure when the ventricles pump blood out of the heart. Diastolic pressure is the pressure between heartbeats when the heart is filling with blood.  

                                    Your blood pressure changes throughout the day based on your activities. For most adults, a normal blood pressure is less than 120 over 80 millimeters of mercury, which is written as your systolic pressure reading over your diastolic pressure reading—120/80 mm Hg. Your blood pressure is considered high when you have consistent systolic readings of 130 mm Hg or higher or diastolic readings of 80 mm Hg or higher. .</p>

                                    <p><br>SYMPTOMS OF HYPERTENSION<br></p>

                                        Hypertension is generally a silent condition. Many people won’t experience any symptoms. It may take years or even decades for the condition to reach levels severe enough that symptoms become obvious. Even then, these symptoms may be attributed to other issues.

                                        Symptoms of severe hypertension can include:<br></p>
                                        
                                        headaches<br>
                                        shortness of breath<br>
                                        nosebleeds<br>
                                        flushing<br>
                                        dizziness<br>
                                        chest pain<br>
                                        visual changes<br>
                                        blood in the urine<br>
                                        <ul class="list-inline"></ul>
                                        These symptoms require immediate medical attention. They don’t occur in everyone with hypertension, but waiting for a symptom of this condition to appear could be fatal.<br>

                                        The best way to know if you have hypertension is to get regular blood pressure readings. Most doctors’ offices take a blood pressure reading at every appointment.<br>

                                        If you only have a yearly physical, talk to your doctor about your risks for hypertension and other readings you may need to help you watch your blood pressure.</p>
                                        <p><br>THERE ARE TWO CAUSES OF HYPERTENSION<br></p>

                                        <p><br>PRIMARY HYPERTENSION<br>
                                        Primary hypertension is also called essential hypertension. This kind of hypertension develops over time with no identifiable cause. Most people have this type of high blood pressure.<br></p>

                                        Researchers are still unclear what mechanisms cause blood pressure to slowly increase. A combination of factors may play a role. These factors include:<br></div>

                                       GENES: Some people are genetically predisposed to hypertension. This may be from gene mutations or genetic abnormalities inherited from your parents.<br>
                                       PHYSICAL CHANGES: If something in your body changes, you may begin experiencing issues throughout your body. High blood pressure may be one of those issues. For example, it’s thought that changes in your kidney function due to aging may upset the body’s natural balance of salts and fluid. This change may cause your body’s blood pressure to increase.<br>
                                       ENVIRONMENT: Over time, unhealthy lifestyle choices like lack of physical activity and poor diet can take their toll on your body. Lifestyle choices can lead to weight problems. Being overweight or obese can increase your risk for hypertension.<br></p>

                                        <p><br>SECONDARY HYPERTENSION<br>
                                            Secondary hypertension often occurs quickly and can become more severe than primary hypertension. Several conditions that may cause secondary hypertension include:<br></p>

                                            kidney disease<br>
                                            obstructive sleep apnea<br>
                                            congenital heart defects<br>
                                            problems with your thyroid<br>
                                            side effects of medications<br>
                                            use of illegal drugs<br>
                                            alcohol abuse or chronic use<br>
                                            adrenal gland problems<br>
                                            certain endocrine tumors<br>
                                           <p><br>FIVE CATEGORIES DEFINE BLOOD PRESSURE READING FOR ADULTS:<br></p>
                                           HEALTHY:A healthy blood pressure reading is less than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).
                                           ELEVATED:The systolic number is between 120 and 129 mm Hg, and the diastolic number is less than 80 mm Hg. Doctors usually don’t treat elevated blood pressure with medication. Instead, your doctor may encourage lifestyle changes to help lower your numbers.
                                           STAGE 1 HYPERTENSION: The systolic number is between 130 and 139 mm Hg, or the diastolic number is between 80 and 89 mm Hg.
                                           STAGE 2 HYPERTENSION: The systolic number is 140 mm Hg or higher, or the diastolic number is 90 mm Hg or higher.
                                           HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS: The systolic number is over 180 mm Hg, or the diastolic number is over 120 mm Hg. Blood pressure in this range requires urgent medical attention. If any symptoms such as chest pain, headache, shortness of breath, or visual changes occur when blood pressure is this high, medical care in the emergency room is needed.<br></p>
                                           <p><br>SOME OF THE MEDICATIONS USED TO TREAT HYPERTENSION INCLUDE:<br></p>

                                           DIURETICS: High sodium levels and excess fluid in your body can increase blood pressure. Diuretics, also called water pills, help your kidneys remove excess sodium from your body. As the sodium leaves, extra fluid in your bloodstream moves into your urine, which helps lower your blood pressure.<br>
                                           ACE INHIBITORS: Angiotensin is a chemical that causes blood vessels and artery walls to tighten and narrow. ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent the body from producing as much of this chemical. This helps blood vessels relax and reduces blood pressure.<br>
                                          AGOITEENSIN II RECEPTOPTOR  Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs): While ACE inhibitors aim to stop the creation of angiotensin, ARBs block angiotensin from binding with receptors. Without the chemical, blood vessels won’t tighten. That helps relax vessels and lower blood pressure.<br>
                                           CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS: Theentering the cardiac muscles of your heart. This leads to less forceful heartbeats and a lower blood pressure. These medicines also work in the blood vessels, causing them to relax and further lowering blood pressure.<br>
                                           ALPHA 2 AGONIST: This type of medication changes the nerve impulses that cause blood vessels to tighten. This helps blood vessels to relax, which reduces blood pressure.<br>

                                           <p><br>TREATMENT OF HIGHBLOOD PRESSURE<br></p>
                                           For most people with high blood pressure, a doctor will develop a treatment plan that may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes alone or with medicines. A risk calculator can help your doctor estimate your risk of complications and choose the right treatment. A healthcare team can help you best manage your blood pressure and prevent complications. This team may include your doctor, a nutritionist, a pharmacist, and specialists for any conditions you may have, including those related to your heart.If your high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or medicine, it may improve once the cause is treated or removed.<br></P>
                                        <p><br>HEALTHY LIFESTYLE<br></p>
                                        CHOOSE HEART HEALTHY FOOD - such as those in the DASH eating plan. NHLBI-funded research has shown that DASH combined with a low-salt eating plan can be as effective as medicines in lowering high blood pressure. Visit Living With the DASH Eating Plan or see Tips to Reduce Salt and Sodium.<br>
                                        AAVOID or LIMIT ALCOHOL - Talk to your doctor about how much alcohol you drink. Your doctor may recommend that you limit or stop drinking alcohol. You can find resources and support at the Alcohol Treatment Navigator from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.<br>
                                       GET REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY - Many health benefits result from being physically active and getting the recommended amount of physical activity each week. Studies have shown that physical activity can help lower and control high blood pressure levels. Even modest amounts of physical activity may help. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor what level of physical activity is right for you. <br>
                                       AIM FOR A HEALTHY WEIGHT - If you are an adult who is living with overweight or obesity, losing 5% to 10% of your initial weight over about 6 months can improve your health. Even losing just 3% to 5% of your weight can improve blood pressure readings.<br>
                                      QUIT SMOKING - Visit Smoking and Your Heart and our Your Guide to a Healthy Heart. Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking. For free help and support to quit smoking, you can call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848).<br>
                                      MANAGE STRESS - Learning how to manage stress and cope with problems can improve your mental and physical health. Learning relaxation techniques, talking to a counselor, and finding a support group can all help<br> GET ENOUGH GOOD QUALITY SLEPP - The recommended amount for adults is 7 to 9 hours of sleep a day. Develop healthy sleep habits by going to sleep and getting up at regular times, following a calming bedtime routine, and keeping your bedroom cool and dark.

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious airborne disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a bacterium that grows and divides inside of cells. The infection, which starts in the lungs, causes nodules known as tubercles, or Ghon focii, which are spots left by dead infected tissue. With time, the disease can spread to other areas of the lung and larger areas of lung tissue may die off, causing cavities. Bacteria can also spread to other organs, including the kidney, brain, and spine.Antibiotics are used for tuberculosis, though treatment is not always simple or effective. TB is not something that is typically vaccinated against in the United States and it can be fatal if left untreated.</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/tb.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <p>Some people develop TB disease soon after becoming infected (within weeks) before their immune system can fight the TB bacteria. Other people may get sick years later, when their immune system becomes weak for another reason.Overall, about 5 to 10% of infected persons who do not receive treatment for latent TB infection will develop TB disease at some time in their lives. For persons whose immune systems are weak, especially those with HIV infection, the risk of developing TB disease is much higher than for persons with normal immune systems. persons who have been recently infected with TB bacteria
                                    Persons with medical conditions that weaken the immune system.<br></p>

                                    Generally, persons at high risk for developing TB disease fall into two categories:<br>
                                    Close contacts of a person with infectious TB disease.<br>
                                    Persons who have immigrated from areas of the world with high rates of TB.<br>
                                    Children less than 5 years of age who have a positive TB test.<br>
                                    Groups with high rates of TB transmission, such as homeless persons, injection drug users, and persons with HIV infection.<br>
                                    Persons who work or reside with people who are at high risk for TB in facilities or institutions such as hospitals, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, nursing homes, and residential homes for those with HIV.<br>

                                    Babies and young children often have weak immune systems. Other people can have weak immune systems, too, especially people with any of these conditions:<br></p>
                                    HIV infection (the virus that causes AIDS)<br>

                                   "Preventing Latent TB Infection from Progressing to TB Disease"<br></>
                                    Many people who have latent TB infection never develop TB disease. But some people who have latent TB infection are more likely to develop TB disease than others. Those at high risk for developing TB disease include:<br></p>

                                    People with HIV infection<br>
                                    People who became infected with TB bacteria in the last 2 years<br>
                                    Babies and young children<br>
                                    People who inject illegal drugs<br>
                                    People who are sick with other diseases that weaken the immune system<br>
                                    Elderly people<br>
                                    People who were not treated correctly for TB in the past<br>


                                  <p><br>TB PREVENTION</p>
                                   In many countries, TB is much more common than in the United States. Travelers should avoid close contact or prolonged time with known TB patients in crowded, enclosed environments (for example, clinics, hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters).

                                   Although multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB are occurring globally, they are still rare. HIV-infected travelers are at greatest risk if they come in contact with a person with MDR or XDR TB.

                                   Air travel itself carries a relatively low risk of infection with TB of any kind. Travelers who will be working in clinics, hospitals, or other health care settings where TB patients are likely to be encountered should consult infection control or occupational health experts. They should ask about administrative and environmental procedures for preventing exposure to TB. Once those procedures are implemented, additional measures could include using personal respiratory protective devices.

                                   Travelers who anticipate possible prolonged exposure to people with TB (for example, those who expect to come in contact routinely with clinic, hospital, prison, or homeless shelter populations) should have a TB skin test or a TB blood test  before leaving the United States. If the test reaction is negative, they should have a repeat test 8 to 10 weeks after returning to the United States. Additionally, annual testing may be recommended for those who anticipate repeated or prolonged exposure or an extended stay over a period of years. Because people with HIV infection are more likely to have an impaired response to TB tests, travelers who are HIV positive should tell their physicians about their HIV infection status.

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">ATHRITIS</h2>
                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Arthritis is more than just wear and tear or an old person’s disease. Find out about the different types of arthritis Arthritis is very common but is not well understood. Actually, “arthritis” is not a single disease; it is an informal way of referring to joint pain or joint disease. There are more than 100 types of arthritis and related conditions. People of all ages, sexes and races can and do have arthritis, and it is the leading cause of disability in America. More than 50 million adults and 300,000 children have some type of arthritis. It is most common among women and occurs more frequently as people get older.

                                    Common arthritis joint symptoms include swelling, pain, stiffness and decreased range of motion. Symptoms may come and go. They can be mild, moderate or severe. They may stay about the same for years but can progress or get worse over time. Severe arthritis can result in chronic pain, inability to do daily activities and make it difficult to walk or climb stairs. 

                                    Arthritis can cause permanent joint changes. These changes may be visible, such as knobby finger joints, but often the damage can only be seen on X-ray. Some types of arthritis also affect the heart, eyes, lungs, kidneys and skin as well as the joints..</p>

                                    <p><br>SYMPTOMS OF ATHRITIS</p>
                                    <p><br>Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include:</p>
                                    Tender, warm, swollen joints<br>
                                    Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity<br>
                                    Fatigue, fever and loss of appetite<br>

                                    <p><br>Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first — particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet.As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body.<br>

                                        <p><br>About 40% of people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Areas that may be affected include:<br></p>

                                    Skin<br>
                                    Eyes<br>
                                    Lungs<br>
                                    Heart<br>
                                    Kidneys<br>
                                    Salivary glands<br>
                                    Nerve tissue<br>
                                    Bone marrow<br>
                                    Blood vessels<br></p>
                                    <p><br>Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission — when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place.<br></p>

                                  <p><br>CAUSES OF ATHRITIS</p>
                                Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. Normally, your immune system helps protect your body from infection and disease. In rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your joints. It can also cause medical problems with your heart, lungs, nerves, eyes and skin.Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more likely to react to environmental factors — such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria — that may trigger the disease.<br></p>
                                    YOUR SEX- Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis.
AGE - Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins in middle age.
FAMILY HISTORY - If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease.
SMOKING - Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity.
EXCESS WEIGHT - People who are overweight appear to be at a somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.

 <p><br>COMPLICATIONS</p>
Rheumatoid arthritis increases your risk of developing:<br>

OSTEOPOROSIS - Rheumatoid arthritis itself, along with some medications used for treating rheumatoid arthritis, can increase your risk of osteoporosis — a condition that weakens your bones and makes them more prone to fracture.<br>
RHEUMATOID NODULESR - These firm bumps of tissue most commonly form around pressure points, such as the ELBOWS - However, these nodules can form anywhere in the body, including the heart and lungs.<br>
\DRY EYES AND MOUTH - People who have rheumatoid arthritis are much more likely to develop Sjogren's syndrome, a disorder that decreases the amount of moisture in the eyes and mouth.<br>
INFECTIONS - Rheumatoid arthritis itself and many of the medications used to combat it can impair the immune system, leading to increased infections. Protect yourself with vaccinations to prevent diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, shingles and COVID-19.<br>
ABNORMAL BODY COMPOSITION - The proportion of fat to lean mass is often higher in people who have rheumatoid arthritis, even in those who have a normal body mass index (BMI).<br>
CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME - If rheumatoid arthritis affects your wrists, the inflammation can compress the nerve that serves most of your hand and fingers.<br>
HEART PROBLEMS - Rheumatoid arthritis can increase your risk of hardened and blocked arteries, as well as inflammation of the sac that encloses your heart.<br>
LUNG DISEASE - People with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased risk of inflammation and scarring of the lung tissues, which can lead to progressive shortness of breath.<br>
LYMPHOMA - Rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of lymphoma, a group of blood cancers that develop in the lymph system.<br></p>


 <p><br>TREATMENTS FOR ATHRITIS</p>
If you start to develop arthritis, see your doctor as soon as symptoms appear. The longer you wait to seek treatment, the more joint damage arthritis may cause. Your doctor can suggest treatment that can slow the progress of arthritis and help keep you mobile.<br>

<p><br>Arthritis treatments include:</p>

Drugs that reduce pain and inflammation. These can include over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen, or drugs your doctor may prescribe.
Drugs that suppress the immune system. These may be taken orally or injected into the affected joint.
Topical creams and ointments. Commonly available over the counter, these treatments are applied to the skin to reduce joint aches and pains.
Physical therapy. In some cases, physical therapy may help strengthen muscles and improve range of motion.
Surgery. Joints that are severely damaged by arthritis may need to be repaired or replaced. Joints most commonly replaced are hips and knees.

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">A peptic ulcer is a sore in the inner lining of the stomach or upper small intestine .Ulcers form when the intestine or stomach's protective layer is broken down. When this happens, digestive juices—which contain hydrochloric acid and an enzyme called pepsin—can damage the intestine or stomach tissue.Treatment cures most ulcers. And symptoms usually go away quickly.Peptic ulcers that form in the stomach are called gastric ulcers. Those that form in the upper small intestine are called duodenal (say "doo-uh-DEE-nul" or "doo-AW-duh-nul") ulcers.</p>

                                    Treatment will vary depending on the cause of your ulcer. Most ulcers can be treated with a prescription from your doctor, but in rare cases, surgery may be required.It’s important to promptly treat an ulcer. Talk to your doctor to discuss a treatment plan. If you have an actively bleeding ulcer, you’ll likely be hospitalized for intensive treatment with endoscopy and IV ulcer medications. You may also require a blood transfusion.
